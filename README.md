# Campgrounds

Campgrounds is a full-stack web application where users can create, view, and review campgrounds. 
This project helped me practice working with RESTful routes, authentication, databases, and full-stack architecture using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Features

- User authentication (register/login/logout)
- CRUD operations for campgrounds
- Commenting system for campground reviews
- Flash messages and basic error handling
- Responsive front-end using Bootstrap
- Authorization middleware (only creators can edit/delete their campgrounds)

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- EJS templating engine
- Passport.js for authentication
- Bootstrap 5 for styling

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
